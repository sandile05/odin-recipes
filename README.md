# odin-recipes

Using the skills i have learnt so far in the odin project

I have completed the the recipe project using mostly html and a bit of css styling to resize the images.

I used anchor tags, unordered lists, ordered lists present the different recipes, their ingredients and the steps needed to make the desired dishes. 

There are 3 recipes.
