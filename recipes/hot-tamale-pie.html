    <p>While this tamale pie has very little to with its south-of-the-boreder namesake, it's a really delicious recipe all the same.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="list-container">
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups diced poblano peppers</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1(16 ounce) jar salsa</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>2(8.5 ounce) boxes dry muffin mix</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk, divided</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
            <li>8 ounces frozen corn, thawed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spray a 9x13-inch casserol dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat starts to brown and release juices, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in poblano peppers, salt, salsa, oregano, and chipotle powder; cook and stir until seasoned beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix one package of corn muffin mix in a large bowl with 1 egg and 1/3 cup of milk. Whisk to combine. In a separate large bowl, mix the second package of corn muffin mix with 1 egg, 1/3 cup of milk and half the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses.</li>
        <li>Spread the prepared corn muffin mixture without cheese into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle corn over the muffin mix, followed by remaining half of the cheeses, then the beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Spoon the corn muffin mix with cheese on top of the beef and carefully spread over the top with a fork, leaving about half an inch from the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, until golden brown</li>
    </ol>
